# ReifiedFunctionViewer
For looking at 8-bit CA rules with lattices reified as points, connected by composition, and following some super simple attractive rules to make structures easier to see. Needs pygame.

Hit space to pause.
Hit 'R' to recolour.
Hit 'Q' to squeeze structures towards the center.
Arrowkeys move view around.

Click on nodes to move them and see their corresponding number.
Once a node is selected, you can use +/- to highlight the node associated with the next or prior number.

Hitting +/- is tedious for bitstring spaces that are big. Hold 9/0 to quickly add or subtract from the number and move to the node associated with the new number.
